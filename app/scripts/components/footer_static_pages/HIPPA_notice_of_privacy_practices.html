			<h3>WHO WILL FOLLOW THIS NOTICE?</h3>
			<p>This Notice describes Hill-Rom’s practices regarding the use of your Protected Health
			Information, specifically including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Any Hill-Rom employee or representative authorized to use information about you</li>
				<li>All subsidiaries (including Advanced Respiratory, Inc.), departments and units of Hill-
				Rom</li>
			</ul>
			<p>“Protected Health Information” (“PHI”) is medical information about you, including
				demographic information, that may identify you and that relates to your past, present, or future
				physical or mental health or condition and related health services. We are required by law to
				protect the privacy of your PHI, to provide you with this Notice of our legal duties and privacy
				practices with respect to your PHI, to notify you following a breach of unsecured PHI, and to
				abide by the terms of this Notice as currently in effect. We reserve the right to revise, amend,
				interpret and administer our privacy practices and this Notice.</p>

			<h3>OUR PLEDGE REGARDING YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>We understand that your Protected Health Information is personal. We are committed to
				protecting your PHI. We create a record of the products and services you receive from Hill-
				Rom. We need this record to provide you with quality care and to comply with certain legal
				requirements. This Notice applies to all of the records of products and services provided to you
				by Hill-Rom. Your other health care providers may have different policies or notices regarding
				their use and disclosure of your medical information created by them.
				This Notice sets forth different reasons for which we may use and disclose your PHI. We will
				limit our uses and disclosures to the minimum amount of PHI necessary to achieve the intended
				purpose of the use or disclosure to the extent required by law.</p>

			<h3>HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>The following categories describe different circumstances in which we use and disclose your
				PHI. For each category of uses or disclosures we will explain what we mean and try to give
				some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the
				ways we are permitted to use and disclose information will fall within one of the categories.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><h4>Treatment.</h4> We may use your PHI to provide you with medical treatment or services. We may
				disclose your PHI to doctors, nurses, home health agencies, hospital discharge planners, case
				managers and other medical and medical equipment providers who are involved in taking care of
				you. For example, a home health agency or hospital discharge planner responsible for your care
				may share PHI with us if the agency or planner believes that you have or are at risk for pressure
				ulcers (bed sores). Or, your physician or another medical service provider may share PHI with
				us if the physician or provider believes you may benefit from use of one of our products.

				We in turn may share that information with case managers, physicians and other medical
				equipment providers so that the product most appropriate for your condition may be provided.
				We also may share information with physicians and other medical providers who are responsible
				for oversight of your treatment. Different departments within Hill-Rom also may share your PHI
				in order to coordinate the products and services you may need.</li>
				<li><h4>Payment.</h4> We may use and disclose your PHI so that the treatment and services you receive
				from Hill-Rom may be billed to and payment may be collected from you, a hospital, a nursing
				home, Medicaid, Medicare, an insurance company or another third party. For example, we may
				need to give Medicare, Medicaid or an insurance company information about your medical
				condition so it will pay us or reimburse you. We also may use and disclose your PHI to
				determine your eligibility and/or obtain prior approval or to determine whether Medicare,
				Medicaid or your insurance company will cover the service or product.</li>
				<li><h4>Health Care Operations.</h4> We may use and disclose your PHI for Hill-Rom’s operations. These
				uses and disclosures are necessary to run our business and make sure that all of our patients
				receive quality care. For example, we may use PHI to review our treatment and services and to
				evaluate the performance of our employees in providing services to you. We also may combine
				the PHI of many Hill-Rom patients to decide what additional services or products we should
				offer, what services or products are not needed, and whether certain new services or products are
				effective. We also may disclose information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students,
				and other health care providers for review and learning purposes. We may remove information
				that identifies you from this set of medical information so others may use it to study health care
				and health care delivery without learning who you are.</li>

				<li><h4>Treatment Alternatives.</h4> We may use and disclose your PHI to tell you about or recommend
					possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.</li>

				<li><h4> Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care and Notification Purposes.</h4> We
				may disclose your PHI to a family member, other relative or close personal friend or any other
				person identified by you who is involved in your medical care or payment for your medical care,
				unless you object to such disclosure. If we make such disclosure, we will only provide the PHI
				that is directly related to such person’s involvement with your health care or payment for your
				health care. We also may make such a disclosure after your death, unless such disclosure is
				contrary to your expressed preference. We may use or disclose your PHI in order to notify or
				assist in notifying a family member, personal representative, close personal friend, or other
				person responsible for your care of your location, general condition or death. In addition, we may
				disclose your PHI to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be
				notified about your condition, status and location.</li>
				<li><h4>Research.</h4> Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose your PHI for research
				purposes. For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of all
				patients who received one product or service to those who received another, for the same
				condition. All research projects, however, are subject to a special approval process. This
				process evaluates a proposed research project and its use of PHI, trying to balance the research
				needs with patients’ need for privacy of their medical information. Before we use or disclose
				PHI for research, the project will have been approved through this research approval process.
				We will disclose your PHI for this purpose either upon receiving your specific permission or
				upon a waiver of such permission from the board that provides the project approval described
				above.<br />
				We also may disclose your PHI to people preparing to conduct a research project, for example, to
				help them look for patients with specific medical needs, so long as the PHI they review does not
				leave Hill-Rom.</li>
				<li><h4>As Required By Law.</h4> We may disclose your PHI when required or permitted to do so by
				federal, state or local law, to the extent that such disclosure is limited to the relevant
				requirements of such law.</li>
				<li><h4>To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety.</h4> We may use and disclose your PHI when
				necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the
				public or another person. Any disclosure, however, would only be to someone able to help
				prevent the threat.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>SPECIAL SITUATIONS</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Military and Veterans.</h4> If you are a member of the armed forces, we may release your PHI as
				required by military command authorities. We also may release PHI about foreign military
				personnel to the appropriate foreign military authority.</li>
				<li><h4>Workers’ Compensation.</h4> We may release your PHI for workers’ compensation or similar
				programs. These programs provide benefits for work-related injuries or illness.</li>
				<li><h4>Public Health Risks.</h4> We may disclose your PHI for public health activities. These activities
				generally include the following:
					<ul>
						<li>To prevent or control disease, injury or disability;</li>
						<li>To report births and deaths;</li>
						<li>To report child abuse or neglect;</li>
						<li>To report reactions to medications or problems with products;</li>
						<li>To notify people of recalls of products they may be using;</li>
						<li>To notify a person who may have been exposed to a disease or may be at risk for
						contracting or spreading a disease or condition;</li>
						<li>To notify the appropriate government authority if we believe a patient has been the victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. We will make this disclosure only if you agree or when required or authorized by law.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><h4>Health Oversight Activities.</h4> We may disclose PHI to a health oversight agency for activities
					authorized by law. These oversight activities include, for example, audits, investigations,
					inspections, and licensure. These activities are necessary for the government to monitor the
					health care system, government programs and compliance with civil rights laws.</li>
				<li><h4>Lawsuits and Disputes.</h4> If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may disclose your
					PHI in response to a court or administrative order. We also may disclose your PHI in response
					to a subpoena, discovery request or other lawful process by someone else involved in the dispute.
					It is our practice to make reasonable efforts to tell you about the request and/or to obtain an order
					protecting the information requested as confidential.</li>
				<li><h4>Law Enforcement.</h4> We may release PHI if asked to do so by a law enforcement official:
				<ul>
					<li>In response to a court order, subpoena, warrant, summons or similar process;</li>
					<li>To identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness or missing person;</li>
					<li>About the victim of a crime if, under certain limited circumstances, we are unable to
					obtain the person’s agreement;</li>
					<li>About a death we believe may be the result of criminal conduct;</li>
					<li>About criminal conduct at Hill-Rom;</li>
					<li>In emergency circumstances to report a crime; the location of the crime or victims; or the
					identity, description or location of the person who committed the crime.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><h4>Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors.</h4> We may release PHI to a coroner or
				medical examiner. This may be necessary, for example, to identify a deceased person or
				determine the cause of death. We also may release PHI of patients to funeral directors as
				necessary to carry out their duties.</li>
				<li><h4>National Security and Intelligence Activities.</h4> We may release your PHI to authorized federal
				officials for intelligence, counterintelligence and other national security activities authorized by
				law.</li>
				<li><h4>Protective Service for the President and Others.</h4> We may disclose your PHI to authorized
				federal officials so they may provide protection to the President, other authorized persons or
				foreign heads of state, or conduct special investigations.</li>
				<li><h4>Inmates.</h4> If you are an inmate of a correctional institution or under the custody of a law
				enforcement official, we may release your PHI to the correctional institution or law enforcement
				official. This release would be necessary (1) for the institution to provide you with health care;
				(2) to protect your health and safety or the health and safety of others; or (3) for the safety and
				security of the correctional institution.</li>
				<li><h4>Fundraising.</h4> We may use or disclose to certain third parties demographic information about
				you and limited information regarding your care for the purpose of raising funds for Hill-Rom.
				You have a right to opt out of receiving such communications. Your decision to opt out of such
				communications will not affect the care that we provide to you.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>OTHER USES AND DISCLOSURES OF YOUR MEDICAL INFORMATION</h3>
			<p>Uses and disclosures of your PHI other than as described above will be made by us only with
			your written authorization. Your written authorization may be revoked at any time so long as
			you revoke your authorization in writing. We will honor your revocation except if we have
			taken action in reliance on your authorization, or your authorization was obtained as a condition
			of obtaining insurance coverage and other law provides the insurer with the right to contest a
			claim under the policy or to contest the policy itself. The types of uses and disclosures that
			require an authorization include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Psychotherapy Notes.</h4> We must obtain an authorization from you to use or disclose
				psychotherapy notes unless the disclosure is made (1) for certain enumerated treatment, payment
				or health care operations purposes; (2) as required by law; (3) for health oversight activities (with
				respect to the originator of the psychotherapy notes); (4) to a coroner or medical examiner for
				purposes of determining a cause of death; or (5) to prevent a serious threat to health or safety.</li>
				<li><h4>Marketing.</h4> We must obtain an authorization for any use or disclosure of your PHI to
				communicate with you about a product or service that encourages you to use or purchase the
				product or service unless the communication is either a face-to-face communication or a
				promotional gift of nominal value. This does not include reminder communications about
				prescriptions, information regarding your course of treatment, case management or care
				coordination, communications to describe a health-related product or service that we provide, or
				contacting you in connection with treatment alternatives. If the marketing involves financial
				compensation, we must notify you of such compensation.</li>
				<li><h4>Sale of PHI.</h4> We must obtain an authorization for any disclosure of your PHI which is a sale of
				PHI and such authorization must state that the disclosure will result in our receipt of financial
				remuneration.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h3>
			<p>You have the following rights regarding medical information we maintain about you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Right to Inspect and Copy.</h4> You have the right to inspect and copy your PHI kept in a
				designated record set that may be used to make decisions about your care. Usually, this includes
				medical and billing records.<br />
				If Hill-Rom uses or maintains an electronic health record with respect to your PHI, you have a
				right to obtain a copy of such information in an electronic format. If you have the right to the
				record in the electronic format, if you so choose, you may direct Hill-Rom to transmit that copy
				directly to another entity or person.<br />
				To inspect and copy your PHI in a designated record set, you must submit your request in writing
				to the Privacy Officer. If you request a copy of the information, we may charge a fee for the
				costs of copying, mailing or other supplies associated with your request.<br />
				We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain very limited circumstances and will
				advise you in writing of the reason for such denial. If you are denied access to your PHI in a
				designated record set, you may request that the denial be reviewed. A licensed health care
				professional chosen by us will review your request and the denial. The person conducting the
				review will not be the person who denied your request. We will comply with the outcome of the
				review.</li>
				<li><h4>Right to Amend.</h4> If you feel that your PHI is incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to
				amend the information. You have the right to request an amendment for as long as the
				information is kept by or for us.<br />
				To request an amendment, your request must be made in writing and submitted to the Privacy
				Officer. In addition, you must provide a reason that supports your request.<br />
				We may deny your request for an amendment if it is not in writing or does not include a reason
				to support the request. In addition, we may deny your request if you ask us to amend PHI that:
				<ul>
					<li>Was not created by us, unless the person or entity that created the information is no
					longer available to make the amendment;</li>
					<li>Is not part of the PHI kept by or for us;</li>
					<li>Is not part of the PHI which you would be permitted to inspect and copy; or</li>
					<li>Is accurate and complete.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Even if we refuse to allow an amendment, however, you are permitted to include a patient
				statement about the information at issue in your medical record.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h4>Right to an Accounting of Disclosures.</h4> You have the right to request an “accounting of
				disclosures.” This is a list of the disclosures we made of your PHI for certain purposes. You do not have the right to an accounting of disclosures which: Hill-Rom has made to you or pursuant
				to your authorization, are disclosures made to carry out treatment, payment and health care
				operations but are not part of an electronic health record, or are disclosures permitted or required
				by law. Beginning January 1, 2011, if you request an accounting of disclosures of your PHI, the
				accounting will include disclosures made to carry out Hill-Rom’s treatment or payment activities
				or health care operations through an electronic health record, if required by then-applicable
				regulations.<br />
				To request this list or accounting of disclosures, you must submit your request in writing to the
				Privacy Officer. Your request must state the period of time for which you are seeking the
				accounting of disclosures, which may not begin more than six years before the date of your
				request for disclosures of PHI not from electronic health record or three years for disclosures of
				PHI from an electronic health record. Your request should indicate in what form you want the
				list (for example, on paper, electronically). The first list you request within a 12-month period
				will be free. For additional lists, we may charge you for the costs of providing the list.<br />
				We will notify you of the estimated costs involved and you may choose to withdraw or modify
				your request at that time before any costs are incurred.
				</li>
				<li><h4>Right to Request Restrictions.</h4> You have the right to request a restriction or limitation on the
				PHI we use or disclose about you for treatment, payment, or health care operations. You also
				have the right to request a limit on the PHI we disclose about you to someone who is involved in
				your care or the payment for your care, like a family member or friend. For example, you could
				ask that we not use or disclose information about a surgery you had.<br />
				We are not required to agree to your request, except if your requested restriction is to prevent
				disclosure of PHI to a health plan for purposes of carrying out payment or health care operations
				(and not for treatment) and the PHI pertains solely to a health care item or service for which you
				have already paid a health care provider out-of-pocket in full. If we do agree to your request, we
				will comply with your request unless the information is needed to provide you with emergency
				treatment.<br />
				To request restrictions, you must make your request in writing to the Privacy Officer. In your
				request you must tell us (1) what information you want to limit; (2) whether you want to limit
				our use, disclosure or both; and (3) to whom you want the limits to apply, for example,
				disclosures to your spouse.</li>
				<li><h4>Right to Request Confidential Communications.</h4> You have the right to request that we
				communicate with you about your personal health matters in a certain way or at a certain
				location. For example, you can ask that we only contact you at work or by mail.
				To request confidential communications, you must make your request in writing to the Privacy
				Officer. We will not ask you the reason for your request. We will attempt to accommodate all
				reasonable requests. Your request must specify how or where you wish to be contacted.</li>
				<li><h4>Right to a Paper Copy of This Notice.</h4> You have the right to a paper copy of this Notice. You
				may ask us to give you a copy of this Notice at any time. Even if you have agreed to receive this
				Notice electronically, you are still entitled to a paper copy of this Notice.<br />
				You may obtain a copy of this Notice at our Web site, www.hill-rom.com.<br />
				To obtain a paper copy of this Notice, contact the Privacy Officer.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>CHANGES TO THIS NOTICE</h3>
			<p>We reserve the right to change this Notice. We reserve the right to make the revised or changed
			Notice effective for PHI we already have about you as well as any PHI we receive in the future.
			We will post a copy of the current Notice on our Web site. The Notice will contain on the first
			page, in the top right-hand corner, the effective date.</p>

			<h3>COMPLAINTS</h3>
			<p>If you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you may file a complaint with Hill-Rom or
			with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. To file a complaint with
			Hill-Rom, direct your correspondence to the Privacy Officer, 1069 State Route 46 East,
